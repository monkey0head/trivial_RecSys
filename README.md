No SOTA, no cutting-adge solutions, trivial code and some links to qualitative papers and code. 
Everything that has long been known about Recommender Systems.


## RecSys repos
  * [A curated list of awesome Recommender System (Books, Conferences, Researchers, Papers, Github Repositories, Useful Sites, Youtube Videos)](https://github.com/jihoo-kim/awesome-RecSys) designed by Jihoo Kim
  * [List of Recommender Systems](https://github.com/grahamjenson/list_of_recommender_systems): SaaS, Open Source, Academic, Benchmarking Recommender systems
  * [Must-read papers on recommendation systems](https://github.com/scnu-dil/awesome-RecSys)

## RecSys Python libraries
Used or seen in practice:
  * [Microsoft Recommenders: Best Practices on Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders) Lots of models including modern hybrid DL architectures
  * [LightFM: well-known hybrid model with ranking loss](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm)
  * [Implicit: Fast Python Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets](https://github.com/benfred/implicit)

Exists:
  * [Surprise: A Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise)
  * [Spotlight:Deep recommender models using PyTorch](https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight)
  * [NVIDIA.HugeCTR: A high efficiency GPU framework designed for Click-Through-Rate (CTR) estimating training](https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR) A part of [Nvidia Merlin](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/announcing-nvidia-merlin-application-framework-for-deep-recommender-systems)
  * [NVTabular: NVTabular is a feature engineering and preprocessing library for tabular data designed to quickly and easily manipulate terabyte scale datasets used to train deep learning based recommender systems](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular)

## Reproducibility
  * [DaisyRec: Developing recommender system in pytorch. Algorithm: KNN, LFM, SLIM, NeuMF, FM, DeepFM, VAE and so on, which aims to fair comparison for recommender system benchmark](https://github.com/AmazingDD/daisyRec) Framework created by the authors of ["Are We Evaluating Rigorously? Benchmarking Recommendation for Reproducible Evaluation and Fair Comparison", RecSys 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3412489)
  * [RecBole: A unified, comprehensive and efficient recommendation library](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole). [Lots of models](https://recbole.io/model_list.html) implemented.
